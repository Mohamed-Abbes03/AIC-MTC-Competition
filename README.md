# EEG-Based Classification System for Motor Imagery (MI) and SSVEP Tasks

This repository contains a full pipeline for EEG-based classification using two tasks: Motor Imagery (MI) and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP). The project was part of the MTC-AIC3 AI competition.

7. *Prediction and Evaluation*

The project is divided into two main pipelines:

- *Motor Imagery (MI)* for binary classification: Left vs. Right hand imagination
- *SSVEP* for multi-class classification: Left / Right / Forward / Backward

Each pipeline follows a structured flow:

1. Data Loading & Label Merging
2. Preprocessing (denoising, normalization, etc.)
3. Feature Extraction (statistical, FFT, wavelet, frequency-band)
4. Feature Selection using GradientBoosting
5. Model Training using XGBoost
6. Prediction & Export

## üß™ Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing

*MI Task:*
- Drop irrelevant columns: Time, Battery, Counter
- Standardize numeric features using validation data statistics
- Select low-noise experiments using mean variance from IMU signals
- Remove trials with incomplete data

*SSVEP Task:*
- Clip training values to the range of validation data to reduce drift
- Bandpass filtering (5‚Äì40 Hz, then 6‚Äì15 Hz) for visual EEG channels

### 2. Segmentation
EEG data was segmented into trials:
- 2250 samples for MI trials
- 1750 samples for SSVEP trials

### 3. Feature Extraction

*Common features for both tasks:*
- Statistical: mean, std, min, max, median, range, energy, skew, kurtosis, zero-crossing rate
- FFT features: power mean/std/max + peak frequency
- Wavelet features using db4
- Band-specific frequency power (e.g., 10Hz, 13Hz)

*MI-specific:*
- Power and power-ratio in Mu/Beta bands from C3/C4/CZ using Welch's method

*SSVEP-specific:*
- Power and power-ratio from OZ, PO7, PO8, PZ at stimulus frequencies (7, 8, 10, 13 Hz)

### 4. Feature Selection
- Used a GradientBoostingClassifier to rank feature importance
- Top 100 features were retained for both tasks

### 5. Model Training
Trained XGBoost classifiers with the following config:

**MI XGBoost Config:**
```python
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=550,
    learning_rate=0.03,
    max_depth=1,
    subsample=0.7,
    colsample_bytree=0.5,
    min_child_weight=4,
    reg_alpha=1
)
```


**SSVEP XGBoost Config:**
```python
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=900,
    learning_rate=0.03,
    max_depth=1,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8
)
```


### 6. Data Augmentation

MI:

    Oversampling with noise: random Gaussian noise added to under-represented classes

SSVEP:

    Frequency-related augmentation: feature values multiplied by small random factors


## üìä Results

    MI Accuracy (Validation): ~76%

    SSVEP Accuracy (Validation): ~62%

## üöß Challenges Faced

| Challenge                          | Solution |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| High variance in raw EEG signals   | Low-noise experiment selection based on IMU signal variance |
| Overfitting on small datasets      | Feature selection + strong regularization + data augmentation |
| Inconsistent feature ranges        | Standardization using validation set only |
| Noisy SSVEP test data              | Bandpass filtering and signal clipping |
